abstract: The number of connected devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) continues growing significantly, with global spending expected to exceed $1 trillion by 2026. Despite this growth, IoT and connected devices face security challenges, as millions of devices are reportedly involved in botnets. IoT and connected devices are more vulnerable to medium- and high-severity attacks since more than 91.5% of the IoT’s traffic is unencrypted. Governments have planned or initiated national registries of certified devices and labeling programs to address these challenges. As those registries and labels remain national, multiple governments have started signing mutual recognition between their programs, adding complexity. This motivated us to create a unified and collaborative labeling registry and a rating system that uses 12 criteria to classify IoT devices. Through multiple experiments, 52 users submitted 252 device classifications. Our proposed tool is helping us identify the criteria that define IoT and connected devices’ security.
